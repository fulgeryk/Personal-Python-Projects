# Personal Python Projects

This repository is my personal Python playground.

It exists as a space to experiment, build, break things, learn deeply, and document my growth as a developer. The goal is not perfection — the goal is progress. Some projects are finished, some are messy, and some are just ideas in motion. That’s intentional.

I use this repo as a lab to explore Python across multiple domains, not as isolated tutorials, but as real problem-solving practice.

## Areas of Exploration

### Core Python & Automation
Python scripting, automation workflows, and GUI automation experiments focused on improving efficiency and building practical tools.

### Web Development
Flask applications, HTTP requests, API integrations, and web scraping projects that explore how Python interacts with the web.

### Desktop & GUI Applications
Graphical desktop applications and UI experiments that focus on usability and interaction design.

### Games & Interactive Projects
Small games and interactive experiments used to explore logic, state, and creative programming.

### Data & Image Processing
Data analysis, statistics, and image processing projects aimed at understanding how Python can extract meaning from raw information.

## Philosophy

This repository is not about copying tutorials.

It’s about:
- understanding why things work
- building projects from scratch
- documenting mistakes
- learning through friction
- iterating until concepts become intuitive

Every project represents a step forward, not a finished product.

## Ongoing Rule

If something is confusing, I investigate it.  
If something breaks, I debug it.  
If something feels hard, I stay with it.

That’s the point of this repo.
